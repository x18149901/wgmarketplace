					<H6 align="center">As one of the world's most polluting industries, fashion needs to change. We're on a mission to make fashion circular, one rental at a time.<br>
					Traditionally, the fashion industry works on a linear model of make > use > dispose. The circular economy is restorative and regenerative by design. With the help of our fabulous renters and lenders, we're making fashion accessible and sustainable*.</H6>

					<p><b>How often</b> do you wear a new item of clothing? Researchers are divided on the actual number, but it’s thought that many people wear clothes between four and seven times before deeming it as “old”. A UK survey last year intimated that shoppers there own about €13 billion worth of clothes they don’t wear. It’s been argued that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, after oil. The business consumes vast volumes of water, chemicals and energy to meet the appetites of the fast fashion industry, worth about $35 billion in the US alone.</p>
					<p>Last year, as the conversation around climate change, sustainability and eco-awareness swelled, the fast fashion industry didn’t seem quite so fashionable any more.</p>
					<p>A growing number of Irish women are seeking an alternative to the high street. Broadcaster Jennifer Zamparelli announced that she was putting “positive pressure” on herself to embrace sartorial sustainability, wearing a refashioned dress on Dancing With The Stars from a previous season. <a href="https://twitter.com/jennifermaguire/status/1224664295264440320?lang=en" target="_blank">“I will not buy a single stitch of clothing this year,” she tweeted. “I’m gonna re-use, borrow and stay out of Penneys. If you see me skulking around Zara, you have full permission to slap me.”</a></br>(twitter.com/jennifermaguire, 04 Feb 2020)**</p>
					<p>Similarly, Kate Middleton was hailed at the 2020 Bafta Awards for “recycling” an Alexander McQueen dress that she wore during a 2012 visit to Malaysia. One newspaper dubbed her the “queen of recycling” after wearing her outfits more than once.</p>
					<p>It’s a curious state of affairs when celebrities are noted for wearing an outfit more than once, but it’s a mindset that has trickled down, and helped to propel the rise of the clothing rental industry.***</p>
